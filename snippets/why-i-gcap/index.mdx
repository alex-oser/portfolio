import { CodeRenderer } from "../../src/components/CodeRenderer";
import { gcap, bonus } from "./code";

I use `gcap` so often it has become a verb. It is able to describe over 90% of my interactions with Git and it makes those interactions easier and quicker. Simply set it in your shell's user profile (ex. .zshrc, .bashrc) and the call it with an optional commit message.

<CodeRenderer language="shell">{gcap}</CodeRenderer>

The below help out the rest of the time when `gcap`-ing is not enough.

<CodeRenderer language="shell">{bonus}</CodeRenderer>
