import { CodeRenderer } from "../../src/components/CodeRenderer";
import { gcap, bonus } from "./code";

I use `gcap` so often it has become a verb. It is able to describe over 90% of my interactions with Git and it makes those interactions easier and quicker. Simply set it in your shell profile (ex. .zshrc, .bashrc) and call it with an optional commit message.

<CodeRenderer language="shell">{gcap}</CodeRenderer>

The other aliases below help out the rest of the time when `gcap`-ing is not enough.

<CodeRenderer language="shell">{bonus}</CodeRenderer>
