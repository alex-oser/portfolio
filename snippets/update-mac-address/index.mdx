Although your physical MAC address comes from your hardware, sometimes you might find yourself wanting to spoof it. This could be for privacy reasons, or it could be because a coffee shop you really like decided that it would be a good idea to limit WiFi access to 2-hour sessions. Either way, the below function works nicely for me on my MacBook Pro running the latest OS (Big Sur). 

I couldn't find anyone to explain *why* we have to keep the first 3 octets of the original MAC address, but from testing with a completely random address it only seemed to work about half the time.

After running the command, make sure to disconnect and reconnect to the WiFi and you should be good to go. 

Since the MAC address is actually tied to your machine, restarting will reset it back to normal.
