Structure is an interactive design tool made for developers to help answer one question they have all asked before:
> *How should I structure my code?*

Any research on this topic quickly reveals that there is not one decisive answer.

There are however a plethora of blogs, podcasts, and repository templates demonstrating examples of how experienced developers and organizations choose to structure their projects. Despite this abundance of information, with no consolidated resource to compare or view them, it can still feel hard to get started and make the right choice. 

Structure aims to help developers rapidly prototype their code and pick the structure that will work the best for them. It can also help to build the mental model of a project that enables a great developer experience.

Most importantly, Structure relies on input from the community to add high quality templates for projects of all languages and frameworks.
